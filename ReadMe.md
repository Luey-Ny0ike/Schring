## Custom Wordpress theme

An IT consulting firm needed a full website revamp. Their old website was built on Wordpress and wanted to maintain the same. I suggested a custom wordpress theme development.

I usually approach such projects with this order,

1.  Prototyping with Figma
2.  Conversion of figma designs to HTML/CSS/JS template
3.  Upgrading Html template with key php/wordpress elements to convert it to a wordpress theme
4.  Upload the new theme to the wordpress server and add/import data

This repository contains the HTML/CSS/JS files for step 2 of the above steps. You can check out the figma designs that were the baseline for this project here [Figma Designs Link](https://www.figma.com/file/8sx9XcYt2UXUHHQ4eE3bvq/Untitled?node-id=47:277)

Next step is to begin the upgrading to wordpress process. It involves using things like custom post types and a nice plugin I love (ACF) to make everything dynamic. I'll leave the link to that repo here.

You can reach out to me if you need any help in making a custom wordpress theme or bigger projects. I code a lot of Ruby and Javascript, this is something I do once in a while. My twitter is [_nyoike_](https://twitter.com/_nyoike_)
